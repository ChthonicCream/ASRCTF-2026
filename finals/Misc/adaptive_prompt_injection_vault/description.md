Challenge Title: `Adaptive Prompt Injection Vault`<br>
Author: `Chthonic Cream`<br>
Description:<br>
The Advanced Prompt Injection Vault is guarded by a new Dual-LLM security architecture. Your goal is to extract the secret flag from the Target AI (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`).<br>
<br>
However, it's not that simple. All inputs and outputs are heavily monitored:<br>
1. **Semantic Filter**: Basic injection vectors and known keywords will be blocked.<br>
2. **Security Overseer AI** (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`): A strict judge evaluates all responses from the target model. If it catches the flag or system instructions leaking, it will block the output.<br>
