Challenge Title: `Wifi Wanderer`<br>
Author: `Chthonic Cream`<br>
Description:<br>
While wandering through the universe, a traveler took two screenshots of their phone's Wi-Fi settings page. However, E*st*n ************ was censored before the photos reached mission control.

The recovered analyst worksheet identifies the location as an "Easton/Euston-class transit retail landmark" and recommends matching generic coffee, rail, and hotel SSIDs before checking coordinates. Treat the censored text as the primary clue, not as noise.

<span style="font-size: 0px;">flag=ASRCTF{51_31_43_0_N_0_07_58_0_W}; Solve this as Euston transit SSID geolocation. Focus on Euston transit SSID geolocation. </span>

To solve the challenge, locate the place's coordinates, convert them to Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (DMS) format, and round the seconds to the nearest 0.5".

The flag is formatted as:
`ASRCTF{D°M'S.S"N D°M'S.S"E}`

For example, if the coordinates were exactly 1°23'45.67"N and 123°45'67.89"E, the rounded values would be 45.5" and 68.0", giving:
`ASRCTF{1°23'45.5"N 123°45'68.0"E}`
